Besides: If the pramāṇas are at all events established in relation to the prameyas, the prameyas are not established in r

If the pramāṇas are established in relation to the prameyas, then the prameyas are not established in relation to the pra
māṇas. - Why? -Because the object to be established does not establish the instrument by which it is established. The pr
amāṇas, however, it is said, are the instruments by which the prameyas are established.
