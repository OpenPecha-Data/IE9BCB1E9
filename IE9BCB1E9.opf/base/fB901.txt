[The opponent may reply:] If it is admitted that they are established in relation [to the objects to be cognized], what d
efect is there? - [The defect is that] what is [already] established is established [again]. For something that is not e
stablished does not require something else.

If it is admitted that the ‘means of true cognition’ are established in relation to the ‘objects to be cognized’, then th
e four ‘means of true cognition’, which are [already] established, are established [anew].- Why? -Because an object that
is not established does not require something else. For instance, Devadatta, who is not [yet] established, does not req
uire anything whatever.But it is not admissible that something that is [already] established be established [anew]. One 
does not do something that is [already] done.
