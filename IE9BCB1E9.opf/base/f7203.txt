Besides:I do not negate anything, nor is there anything to be negated. You, therefore, calumniate me when you say: ‘You n
egate’.

Even that you could rightly say, if I negated something. I, however, do not negate anything, for there is nothing to be n
egated.Thus, while, all things being void, there is neither a thing to be negated nor a negation, you make an absurd cal
umny when you say: ‘You negate’.
