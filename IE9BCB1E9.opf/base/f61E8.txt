All things prevail for him, for whom prevails this voidness. Nothing prevails for him for whom voidness does not prevail.

For whom this voidness prevails, for him all things - mundane and supramundane - prevail. - Why? -Because Dependent Origi
nation prevails for him for whom voidness prevails. The Four Noble Truths prevail for him for whom Dependent Orignation 
prevails. The results of monastic life as well as all special acquisitions prevail for him whom the Four Noble Truths pr
evail.The Three Jewels, viz., the Buddha, the Dharma and the Saṃgha, prevail for him for whom all the special acquisitio
ns prevail.For whom Dependent Origination prevails, for him merit, the cause of merit, the result of merit, demerit, the
cause of demerit, the result of demerit, - all these prevail.For whom merit and demerit, the causes of merit and demeri
t and the results merit and demerit prevail, for him passion, the origination of passion, and the objective grounds of p
assion prevail.For whom all that prevails, for him the law concerning the happy and the unhappy states, the attainment o
f those states, the way leading to those states, the act of passing beyond those states, the means of passing beyond tho
se states, and all worldly conventions are established.They are to be understood individually by each person, following 
this direction: a part [only] can be taught in words.I adore that incomparable Buddha who taught Voidness, Dependent Ori
gination and the Middle Way as equivalent.

Here ends this work of the venerable master Nāgārjuna.
