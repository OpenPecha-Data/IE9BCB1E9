If people conversant with the state of things say that the good things have a good intrinsic nature, that has to be state
d in detail.

People conversant with the state of things think that the good things have a good intrinsic nature. But that has to be st
ated by you in detail:this is that good intrinsic nature; these are those good things; this is that good consciousness; 
this is that intrinsic nature of the good consciousness, and so on.This, however, is not seen to be soThus your statemen
t that the intrinsic nature of each individual thing has been explained is not valid.
