This is a defective proposition. Fire does not illuminate itself, for its non-perception is not seen to be comparable to 
that of a pot in darkness.

Your proposition that the pramāṇas establish themselves as well as other things like fire [that illuminates itself as wel
l as other things] is defective. For fire does not illuminate itself.A pot, not illuminated by fire, is first not percei
ved in darkness. Then, being illuminated by fire, it is perceived. If, in the same manner, fire, not being illuminated, 
first existed in darkness and then were illuminated, it would be possible to say: it illuminates itself.This, however, i
s not the case. Thus this assumption, too, is not valid.
