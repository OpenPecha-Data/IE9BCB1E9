‘Now [you may say:] There is an intrinsic nature, but that does not belong to the things’ - this suspicion of yours is no
t shared by us.

We do not, indeed, deny the intrinsic nature of the things. Nor do we affirm the intrinsic nature of a certain object apa
rt from the things.Now, this being so, your criticism: ‘If the things are devoid of an intrinsic nature, you should expl
ain to what other object, apart from thethings, there now happens to belong the intrinsic nature, is thrown far away. It
is no criticism at all.
