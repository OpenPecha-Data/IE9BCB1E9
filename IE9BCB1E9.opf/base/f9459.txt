If you think that the same holds true of the negation of the negation also, that is false. It is your proposition which b
y virtue of its specific character is thus rendered defective, not mine.

You may think: ’According to this very method a negation of negation also is impossible; so your negation of the statemen
t negating the intrinsic nature of all things is impossible’.-To this we reply: This also is false. - Why ? - Because th
e objection applies [only] to the specific character of your proposition, not to that of mine. It is you who say that al
l things are void, not I. The initial thesis is not mine. - In these circumstances, your staternent that, such being the
case, a negation of negation also is impossible, is not valid.
