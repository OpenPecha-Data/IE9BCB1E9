Furthermore:If such and such objects are established for you through the pramāṇas, tell me how those pramāṇas are establi
shed for you.

If you think that such and such ‘objects of true cognition’ are established through the ‘instruments of true cognition’, 
just as the things to be measured are established through the measuring instruments, [we ask:] How are those ‘instrument
s of true cognition’, viz., perception, inference, identification and verbal testimony, established?If [you say that] th
e pramāṇas are established without the help of pramāṇas, then [your] proposition that [all] objects are established thro
ugh pramāṇas is abandoned.If the pramāṇas are established through other pramāṇas, then there is an infinite series. If y
ou think that the ‘objects of true cognition’ are established through the ‘means of true cognition’ and that those ‘mean
s of true cognition’ are established through other ‘means of true cognition’, then there follows an infinite series - Wh
at harm is there if there is an infinite series?
