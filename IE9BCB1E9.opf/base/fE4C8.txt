Neither the beginning nor the middle nor the end can then be established.

If there is an infinite series, the beginning cannot be established. - Why? - Because those pramāṇas are established thro
ugh other pramāṇas, and those others again through other pramāṇas. Thus there is no beginning.[And] if there is no begin
ning, how can there be a middle? How can there be an end?Consequently, the statement that those pramāṇas are established
through other pramāṇas is not valid.
