Furthermore:There would be neither merit nor demerit nor the worldly conventions . All things, being endowed with an intr
insic nature, would be permanent - for that which has no cause is permanent.

If this is so, what defect follows for you who reject DependentOrigination?- There is no merit. There is no demerit. Nor 
do exist the worldly conventions. - Why? -Because all that is dependently originated; how will it be, if there is no dep
endent origination?Moreover, being endowed with an intrinsic nature, not dependently originated and devoid of a cause, i
t would be permanent. - Why? -Because things that have no cause are permanent.- There would thus follow that very non-pr
actice of religious life. And you would contradict your own tenet- Why? - Because the Lord has taught that all condition
ed things are impermanent. They become permanent, because they are [Supposed to be] endowed with an intrinsic nature and
hence [to be] permanent.
