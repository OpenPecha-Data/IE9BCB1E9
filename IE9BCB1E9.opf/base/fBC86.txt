This statement is not endowed with an intrinsic nature. There is therefore no abandonment of position on my part. There i
s no discordance, and [hence] there is no special reason to be stated.

This statement of mine, being dependently originated, is not endowed with an intrinsic nature. As previously stated, sinc
e it is not endowed with an intrinsic nature, it is void.And since this statement of mine is void, just as all other thi
ngs are void, there is no discordance.For, there would be a discordance [only] if we said: This statement is non-void, w
hile all other things are void. We, however, do not say that. There is, therefore, no discordance.And since the followin
g discordance, this statement is non-void while all other things are void, does not exist, we do not have to state the s
pecial reason: for this reason this statement is non-void while all [other] things are void.- In these circumstances, yo
ur statement: ‘There is on your part an abandonment of position, there is a discordance, and you should state the specia
l reason’, is not valid.(noe english)
