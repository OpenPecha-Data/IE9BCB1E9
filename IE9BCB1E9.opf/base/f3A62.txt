If the things had no intrinsic nature, then even the name ‘absence of intrinsic nature’ would not exist; for there is no 
name without an object [to be named].

If all things were devoid of an intrinsic nature, there would, nevertheless, be an absence of intrinsic nature. [But] the
n, even the name ‘absence of intrinsic nature’ would not exist.- Why? - Because there is no name whatsoever without an o
bject [to be named].Thus, since the name exists, there is an intrinsic nature of the things; and since they have an intr
insic nature, all things are non-void.Your statement, therefore, that all things are devoid of an intrinsic nature and t
hat, being devoid of an intrinsic nature, they are void, is not valid.
