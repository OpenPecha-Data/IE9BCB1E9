And the same defect exists also with regard to the bad things, the indeterminate things, those things which lead to emanc
ipation, and so on. Thus, all that is conditioned certainly becomes for you unconditioned.

And the same method that has been indicated, concerning the good things, applies also to the bad things, to the indetermi
nate things, to those things which lead to emancipation, and so on.Thus all that, though conditioned, turns out to be un
conditioned for you. - Why? -Because, there being no cause, there is no origination, no subsistence and no destruction. 
[And] there being no origination, no subsistence and no destruction, all that is conditioned turns out to be uncondition
ed, because of the absence of the specific character of’ the conditioned.In these circumstances, your statement that all
things are non-void because the good and other things have an intrinsic nature, is not valid.
