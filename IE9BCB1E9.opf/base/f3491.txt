If [it is true that] negation is only of an existent, then this voidness is established - for you negate the things’ bein
g devoid of an intrinsic nature.

If negation is only of the existent and not of the non-existent, and if you negate the being-devoid of-an-intrinsic-natur
e of all things, then the being-devoid-of-an-intrinsic-nature of all things is established.Since, in virtue of your stat
ement, negation exists’, and since the being-devoid-of-an-intrinsic-nature of all things has been negated, voidness is e
stablished.
