If the son is to be produced by the father, and if that father is to be produced by that very son, tell me which of these
produces which other.

Supposing somebody said: the son is to be produced by the father, and that father is to be produced by that very son, tel
l me who is to be produced by whom.In exactly the same manner you say: the prameyas are to be established by the pramāṇa
s, and those very pramāṇas in turn are to be established by those very prameyas. Now, which of these are to be establish
ed for you by which others?
